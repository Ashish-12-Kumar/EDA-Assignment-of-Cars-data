# EDA-Assignment-of-Cars-data
I have completed this assignment during my data science internship at TwiLearn.
I analyzed the cars dataset and perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).
Tools used - Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
First I go through the data and eliminate irrelevant columns and renaming the remaning columns.
and dropping the duplicate rows and missing values.
I plot a boxplot and remove outliers by IQR method.
I analyzed the data uisng various charts like boxplot, distplot, subplot, histogram, scatterplot, barplot, heatmap.
